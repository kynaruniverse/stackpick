                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Stack Pick is a UK-based gaming gear recommendation site. We help gamers build their perfect setup by curating the best headsets, keyboards, mice, monitors, and chairs available in the UK market.</p>
                
                <p>We focus on real-world performance, UK pricing, and actual availability - no US-centric recommendations or products you can't actually buy.</p>

                <h2>Our Testing Process</h2>
                <p>Every product we recommend goes through hands-on testing:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Headsets:</strong> Tested in CS2, Valorant, and Warzone for sound quality and mic clarity. We wear each headset for 4+ hour sessions to assess comfort.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Keyboards:</strong> Tested in competitive games and typing scenarios. We measure actuation force, assess build quality, and use each keyboard for 40+ hours.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mice:</strong> Tested across FPS, MMO, and MOBA games. We measure sensor accuracy, click latency, and durability. Each mouse gets 30+ hours of testing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Monitors:</strong> We test input lag, response times, color accuracy, and real gaming performance across multiple genres.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Chairs:</strong> We sit in each chair for full 8-hour days over multiple weeks, assessing comfort, build quality, and ergonomic support.</p>

                <h2>Why Trust Us</h2>
                <p>We're gamers who understand what matters: performance, value, and UK availability. We don't recommend products we wouldn't buy ourselves.</p>
                
                <p>All prices are in GBP. All products are available in the UK. All recommendations are based on real testing and research.</p>
