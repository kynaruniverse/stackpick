                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Stack Pick is a UK-based gaming gear recommendation site. We help gamers build their perfect setup by curating the best headsets, keyboards, mice, monitors, and chairs available in the UK market.</p>
                
                <p>We focus on real-world performance, UK pricing, and actual availability - no US-centric recommendations or products you can't actually buy.</p>

                <h2>Our Research Process</h2>
                <p>Every product we recommend is carefully researched and curated based on multiple factors:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Expert Reviews:</strong> We analyze professional reviews from trusted tech publications, YouTube reviewers, and industry experts to understand real-world performance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>User Feedback:</strong> We study thousands of verified purchase reviews on Amazon, Reddit gaming communities, and tech forums to identify consistent patterns in quality, durability, and value.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Specifications Analysis:</strong> We compare technical specs like driver size (headsets), actuation force (keyboards), DPI ranges (mice), refresh rates (monitors), and ergonomic features (chairs) to ensure products meet gaming standards.</p>
                
                <p><strong>UK Market Research:</strong> We verify pricing, availability, and warranty support specifically for UK buyers. Products are only recommended if they're readily available and competitively priced in the UK market.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Value Assessment:</strong> We evaluate price-to-performance ratios across budget, mid-range, and premium segments to ensure every recommendation offers genuine value.</p>

                <h2>How We Select Products</h2>
                <p>Our curation process focuses on:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Performance:</strong> Does it deliver the features gamers actually need? We prioritize products with proven performance in competitive and casual gaming scenarios.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Build Quality:</strong> Is it built to last? We research durability based on long-term user experiences and known reliability issues.</p>
                
                <p><strong>UK Availability:</strong> Can you actually buy it in the UK at a fair price? We filter out products that are US-only, overpriced due to import costs, or chronically out of stock.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Real-World Value:</strong> Would we recommend this to a friend? Every product must offer clear value for its price bracket.</p>

                <h2>Why Trust Us</h2>
                <p>We're gamers who understand what matters: performance, value, and UK availability. We research extensively so you don't have to wade through hundreds of options and contradictory reviews.</p>
                
                <p>All prices are in GBP. All products are available in the UK. All recommendations are based on thorough research and genuine assessment of value.</p>

                <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack Pick is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk.</strong></p>
                
                <p>This means when you click our product links and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. These commissions help us keep the site running and continue providing free gaming gear recommendations.</p>
                
                <p>Our affiliate relationship does not influence our recommendations. We only recommend products we genuinely believe offer value to UK gamers based on our research. Whether we earn a commission or not, our goal is to help you make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
                
                <p>We regularly update our recommendations as new products launch and prices change to ensure you're getting the most current information.</p>

                <h2>Our Promise</h2>

                ✓ UK-focused pricing and availability<br>
                ✓ Regular price and product updates<br>

                ✓ No sponsored content disguised as reviews<br>
                ✓ Products we'd actually recommend to friends</p>

                <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
                <p>We don't accept payment from manufacturers to recommend products. We don't create "Top 50" lists with products we haven't researched. We don't recommend US-only products that UK gamers can't easily buy. We don't inflate recommendations with sponsored content.</p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>Have questions, feedback, or product suggestions? We'd love to hear from you.</p>
