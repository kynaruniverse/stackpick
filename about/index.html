                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Stack Pick is a UK-based gaming gear recommendation site. We help gamers build their perfect setup by curating the best headsets, keyboards, mice, monitors, and chairs available in the UK market.</p>
                
                <p>We focus on real-world performance, UK pricing, and actual availability - no US-centric recommendations or products you can't actually buy.</p>

                <h2>Our Research Process</h2>
                <p>Every product we recommend is carefully researched and curated based on multiple factors:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> We analyze real gamer feedback from UK gaming communities on Reddit, Discord servers, and tech forums to identify products with consistent real-world satisfaction.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Long-term Experiences:</strong> Rather than relying solely on launch-day reviews, we focus on crowd-sourced experiences from gamers who've used these products for months. We look for patterns: What do people still love after 6 months? What breaks easily? What's genuinely worth the price?</p>
                
                <p><strong>UK Market Research:</strong> We verify pricing, availability, and warranty support specifically for UK buyers. Products are only recommended if they're readily available and competitively priced in the UK market.</p>

                <h2>How We Select Products</h2>
                <p>We curate recommendations by researching what UK gamers actually use and recommend in communities like r/buildapc, r/pcmasterrace, and r/GamingUK.</p>
                
                <p>Our selection focuses on performance, build quality, UK availability, and real-world value. Every recommendation is verified for current UK pricing on Amazon.</p>

                <h2>Why Trust Us</h2>
                <p>We're gamers who understand what matters: performance, value, and UK availability. We research extensively so you don't have to wade through hundreds of options and contradictory reviews.</p>
                
                <p>All prices are in GBP. All products are available in the UK. All recommendations are based on thorough research and genuine assessment of value.</p>

                <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack Pick is a participant in the Amazon EU Associates Programme, an affiliate advertising programme designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.co.uk.</strong></p>
                
                <p>This means when you click our product links and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. These commissions help us keep the site running and continue providing free gaming gear recommendations.</p>
                
                <p>Our affiliate relationship does not influence our recommendations. We only recommend products we genuinely believe offer value to UK gamers based on our research. Whether we earn a commission or not, our goal is to help you make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
                
                <p>We regularly update our recommendations as new products launch and prices change to ensure you're getting the most current information.</p>

                <h2>Our Promise</h2>

                ✓ Products we'd actually recommend to friends</p>

                <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
                <p>We don't accept payment from manufacturers to recommend products. We don't create "Top 50" lists with products we haven't researched. We don't recommend US-only products that UK gamers can't easily buy. We don't inflate recommendations with sponsored content.</p>

                <h2>Contact</h2>
                <p>Have questions, feedback, or product suggestions? We'd love to hear from you.</p>
