The Focus Pro has a higher max DPI (35K vs 32K) and supports 4000Hz polling with the HyperPolling dongle. In practice, at the DPI ranges anyone actually uses (400–3200), you will not feel a difference. Both sensors are used by top-ranked competitive players."

Higher polling means more position updates per second, which reduces input lag. The difference between 1000Hz and 4000Hz is measurable in microseconds — real in theory, imperceptible in practice for all but the highest-level pros. If you're not playing at the absolute top of the ladder, 1000Hz is perfectly fine."

The Viper V3 Pro is ambidextrous — it works for both hands and suits a wider range of grip styles and hand sizes. If you're left-handed, Viper is your only option here. If you've used a G Pro before and loved it, Superlight 2 is the natural upgrade."

Effectively infinite battery life. The Sony H9 has 32 hours which is good, but you will eventually have a dead headset at an inconvenient moment. For serious gaming, the Nova Pro's system is a meaningful advantage."
