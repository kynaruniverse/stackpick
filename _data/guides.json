A real 50mm driver from a reputable brand will outperform any no-name brand at the same price.\n\nWireless mice under £25 from unknown brands — cheap Bluetooth gaming mice will have noticeable lag. Spend the £48 for the ATK VXE MAD R or buy a good wired mouse instead."

You will not meaningfully upgrade any of these components for 5+ years.\n\nOn the monitor: 480Hz vs 240Hz OLED is justified specifically if you play competitive FPS at a high level and have the GPU to push 400+ FPS. For everything else, the £1500 build 240Hz OLED is just as good.\n\nOn the chair: the Herman Miller Aeron amortised over 10 years is £110/year for no back pain. If you sit at a desk 6+ hours a day, that is rational spending."
