# Stack Pick

UK-focused gaming gear recommendations. Researched picks for headsets, keyboards, mice, monitors, and chairs.

## 🎯 What This Is

Stack Pick helps UK gamers find the right gear without wading through US-centric reviews, sponsored content, or 50-item "best of" lists. We research what the UK gaming community actually recommends and verify UK pricing/availability.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
